        <h3>Radioactivity</h3>
        
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
            In 1896, Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) a French scientist, accidentally
discovered radioactivity. He found that a photographic plate, wrapped well to
protect it from visible light, was blackened by a mineral containing uranium.
He concluded that the mineral emitted a new kind of radiations which occured
without any external cause. The emission of these radiations is not affected
by external factors like temperature, pressure, electric field and magnetic field.
The radiations were called Becquerel rays.
        </p>
        <P><b>
        The property of spontaneous disintegration of certain unstable atomic nuclei
with the emission of certain radiations, is called radioactivity. This is referred
to as natural radioactivity. Radioactivity produced artifically or induced, is called
artificial or induced radioactivity. The radiations emitted by radioactive elements
are called radioactive radiations.</b>
        </p>
        
        <h4>NATURE OF RADIOACTIVE RADIATIONS</h4>
        <p>
            Rutherford, a British physicist and others studied the nature of radioactive
radiations, in 1898. They found that the radiations can be classified into three
distinct types. They named these three types as alpha (α) rays, beta (β ) rays
and gamma ( γ ) rays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Experiments show that α -rays consist of positively charged particles, β -
rays consist of negatively charged particles and γ -rays are electrically neutral.
All radioactive atoms emit either α -rays or β -rays, never both, and this may
be accompanied by γ -rays. Alpha rays (or α -particles) are nothing but helium
nuclei, i.e. an α -particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons bound together.
Beta rays are electrons, identical to those that orbit the nucleus. But they are
created within the nucleus. Gamma rays are high energy photons whose energy
is higher than that of X-rays.
        </p>
        
        <h4>TRANSMUTATION</h4>
        <p>When a radioactive nucleus emits an α particle, the remaining nucleus will be
different from the original because there is loss of two protons and two neutrons.
For example, radium 226 (A = 226, Z = 88) is an α emitter. It changes (decays) to a
nucleus with Z = (88-2)=86 and A = (226-4)=222. The new nucleus is radon (Rn).
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The original nucleus is called parent nucleus and the new nucleus is called
daughter nucleus. The changing of one element into another is known as
transmutation.</p>
        <p>The transmutation of radium 226 into radon 222 can be written as</p>
        <p>88Ra226 α→</p>
        <p>86Ra222</p>
        <p>Transmutation also occurs when a nucleus decays with the emission of
a β particle. For example, Carbon-14 decays with the emission of a β particle;
this can be written as</p>
        <p>6C14β→</p>
        <p>7N14</p>
        <p>During β decay a neutron in a nucleus changes to a proton and an electron
is emitted; this is how Z increases by 1.</p>
        
        <h4>HALF-LIFE</h4>
        <p>
            Theoretically, the decay process of a radioactive element is never complete
and there is always some residual radioactivity. In other words, time taken for
all the atoms to disintegrate, is infinite. For this reason, the half-life of a radioactive
element is considered. Half-life of a radiactive element is defined as the time
taken by a radioactive sample of that element, to get reduced to half its
initial amount. Half-life is useful in comparing the activities of different
radioactive elements. Half-life varies from micro seconds to billions of years.
        </p>
        <h4>INDUCED RADIOACTIVITY</h4>
        <p>
<b>The phenomenon by which radioactivity is induced in an element, is called
induced radioactivity or artificial radioactivity.</b>
When a stable nucleus is bombarded with a high energy particle, it gets
changed into another which is often radioactive. For example, when aluminium
is bombarded by α particles, it produces radio-phosphorus<br>
13Al27 + 2He4 → 15P30 + 0n1<br>
15P30 which is radioactive with a half life about 3 minutes, decays to a
stable isotope of silicon by emitting a positron which has the same mass as
electron, but positive charge.<br>
15P30 → 14Si30 + +1e0 (or β +)<br>
Curie Joliot and her husband Frederick Joliot were the first to discover induced
radioactivity in 1934. They were awarded 1934 Nobel prize in chemistry.
They bombarded elements aluminium and boron with α particles. They observed that
the targets continued to emit radiations even after the removal of the α source. The
radiations consisted of positrons.

        <h4>ISOTOPES AND RADIO-ISOTOPES</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Isotopes :</b> Atoms of a given element, have the same atomic number, that is
they contain the same number of protons. However, they may contain different
numbers of neutrons. They correspond to the same element and are chemically
indistinguishable; they have different mass numbers (Iso means same, tope
means same place; they occupy the same place in the periodic table).
Therefore atoms of the same element having same number of protons
(atomic number) but different number of neutrons (different mass numbers), are
called isotopes. Isotopes may be naturally occuring or artificially made.<br>
<b>Examples :</b> Normal hydrogen 1H1, deuterium 1H2 and tritium 1H3 are the isotopes
of hydrogen. 6C11, 6C12, 6C13 and 6C14 are the isotopes of carbon. Uranium has
two isotopes namely 92U235 and 92U238.<br>
<b>Radio-istopes :</b> The term radio-isotope is the shortened form of radioactive
isotope. If the isotope of an element is radioactive, then the isotope, is called
radio-isotope, referred to as radio-nuclide. Atleast one radio-isotope of every
element is available. Over a thousand of them can be made artifically, mostly
in a nuclear reactor using slow neutrons as bombarding particles.<br>
<b>Examples :</b> Cobalt-60 an isotope of cobalt is radioactive; it is usually referred
to as radio-cobalt. Radio-iodine (I131), radio-iron (Fe59) radio-sodium (Na24), radiophosphorous
(P30), radio-cobalt (Co60), radio-sulphur (S35) and radio-carbon (C14)
are some of the radio isotopes.<br>
<b>Uses of Radio - Isotopes :</b> Radioisotopes find applications in various fields;
some are listed below.<br>
a) Radio-phosphorous is used in agriculture to determine the kind of phosphate
required for a given soil and crop.<br>
b) Radio-iodine is used in the treatment of overactive thyroid glands and
radio-cobalt in the treatment of cancer. Radio-sodium is used to study the
action of medicines.<br>
c) Radio-cobalt or radio-iridium are used in industry to check machine parts.<br>
d) Radio-carbon is used to estimate the age of fossils and archaeological
specimens.

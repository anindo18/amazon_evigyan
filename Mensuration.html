                        <p>Wheels of a road roller, a circular based storage tank etc will suggest you, the
concept of a right circular cylinder.</p>
                        <p>1. The right circular cylinder</p>
                        <img src="image_math/11.png" width="300" height="300">
                        <p>A right circular cylinder is a solid
described by revolution of a rectangle
about one of its sides which remains
fixed.</p>
                        <p>AP = Radius of the circular plane</p>
                        <p>AB = Axis of the cylinder</p>
                        <p>PQ = Height of the cylinder</p>
                        <p>Features of a right circular cylinder</p>
                        <p>1) A right circular cylinder has two plane surfaces, circular in shape.</p>
                        <p>2) The curved surface joining the plane surfaces is the lateral surface of the cylinder.</p>
                        <p>3) The two circular planes are parallel to each other and also congruent.</p>
                        <p>5) All the points on the lateral surface of the right circular cylinder are equidistant from</p>
                        <p>6) Radius of circular plane is the radius of the cylinder.</p>
                        <p>Two types of cylinders :</p>
                        <p>1. Hollow cylinder and</p>
                        <p>2. Solid cylinder</p>
                        <p>A hollow cylinder is formed by the lateral surface only.</p>
                        <img src="image_math/12.png" width="200" height="100">
                        <p>Example : A pipe</p>
                        <p>A solid cylinder is the region bounded by two circular plane surfaces and also
the lateral surface.</p>

                        <p>A. Lateral Surface area :</p>

                        <p>Activity :</p>
                        <p> 1. Take a strip of paper having width equal to the height of the cylinder.</p>
                        <p>2. Wrap the strip around the lateral surface of the cylinder and cut the overlapping
strip along the vertical line. (say PQ)</p>
                        <p>3. You will get a rectangular paper cutting which exactly covers the lateral surface<p>
                        <p>4. Area of the rectangle is equal to the area of the curved surface of the cylinder.</p>

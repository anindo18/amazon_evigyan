        <p>Trait is a distinguishing feature of  character which occurs in two forms like dominant and  recessive.The Father of Genetics is Gregor Johann Mendel. He conducted experiments on garden pea plant. Heredity is transfer of characters from parents to progeny.Gene is a structural and functional unit of heredity and variations.Alleles are a pair of alternative forms of a gene.Homozygous is a condition in which a gene possess a pair of  same allels ( TT/tt) for a single character. Gene is a segment of DNA and formerly called factors by Mendel.Heterozygous is a condition in which a gene possess a pair of  different allels (Tt) for a single character.

Phenotype is a morphological expression of a single character.Punnet Square is a statistical method used by Mendel to check his experimental results.Filial generation is expressed as generations of parents.Dominant trait is a trait which can express its character by suppressing the expression of another trait.Recessive trait is a trait which can’t individually express its character due to dominance of another trait.Dihybrid Inheritance is conducted with two characters and their four contrasting traits.Sex Determination is mainly expressed with sex chromosomes like X and Y. XX represents female and XY represents male.</p>
        
         <h4>Evolutionary Relationships 1</h4>

        <p>Evolution is the sequence of gradual changes over millions of years in which new species are produced.	 Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist proposed theory of  Natural Selection.	 Variations are the differences in characters among individuals of a species.	 Mutation is a sudden, random, unwanted and heritable change in the organisms .	 Gene Flow is transfer of genes from one population to another population.	 Movement of living organisms from one place to another place for protection, reproduction, shelter is known as Migration.	 Natural selection explains  that the organisms which are physiologically, behaviourally better adapted for environment  are selected. They can survive and reproduce.

Genetic Drift is a deviation from a small population due to chance variation.Species can be defined as a group of individuals of same kind which can interbreed and produce fertile progeny.	 Any reproductive isolation leads to Speciation, which mean formation of new species from a single species.	 Process of speciation - genetic drift: It  is due to changes in the frequencies of particular genes by chance alone.	 Process of speciation - Natural selection: Variations caused in individuals due to natural selection leads to formation of new species.	 Process of speciation - splitting of population: A population splits into different sub populations due to geographical isolation that leads to formation of new species.</p>
        
         <h4>Evolutionary Relationships 2</h4>

        <p>Homologous Characteristics are the organs have the same basic structure but different functions. Ex: Fore limbs of human, fore limb of lizard	 Analogous characteristics are the organs have different structures but have same functions. Ex: Wing of insect, wing of bird	 Fossils are the remains of a plant or animal that existed in a past geological age and that has been excavated from the soil.	 Fossilisation is the process of fossilizing a plant or animal that existed in some earlier age.

When two unrelated organisms become quite alike after a period of time through few generations, it assumes that both have common ancestor. This phenomenon is known  as Biological convergence.Broccoli, Kohlrabi, Kale are produced from its ancestor Wild cabbage by artificial selection.	 Tools to trace evolutionary relationships are fossils, DNA sequences and embryological evidences.</p>

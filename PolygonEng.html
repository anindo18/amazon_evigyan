                        <p><b>1.Polygon</b></p>
                        <p>closed figure bounded by straight line segments.
The region bounded by a polygon is polygonal region</p>
                        <p><b>2. Regular Polygon :</b></p>
                        <p>It is a polygon having equal sides and equal angles.
All regular polygons are cyclic.</p>
                        <p><b>3. Polyhedron :</b></p>
                        <p>A closed figure in the space bounded by polygonal faces is a polyhedron. A
polyhedron divides the space into two regions, within the polyhedron and outside it.
Polyhedra is the plural of polyhedron.</p>
                        <p><b>4. Polyhedral solid :</b></p>
                        <p>A solid bounded by a polyhedron is a polyhedral solid. For a polyhedron, we denote
the number of faces by F, edges by E and vertices by V.</p>
                        <p><b>5. Regular Polyhedra :</b></p>
                        <p>A polyhedron is called a regular polyhedron, if its faces are congruent regular
polygons. There are only five types of regular polyhedra. They are</p>
                        <p>1. Tetrahedron 2. Hexahedron
3. Octahedron 4. Dodecahedron and 5. Icosahedron</p>
                        <p>These five polyhedra are known as ‘Platonic Solids’.</p>
                        
                            
                        <p>We know a polygon is a simple closed figure made up of only line segments.
                         We can classify polygons according to the number of sides or vertices.</p>
                        <p>The simple polygon we know is a triangle. A triangle has three sides and, thus, is a three-sided polygon.
                         A four-sided polygon is called a quadrilateral. </p>
                        <p>A five sided polygon is called a pentagon.</p>
                        <p>In this manner, we can obtain a six-sided polygon called a hexagon, a seven-sided polygon, called a heptagon, and so on.</p>
                        <p>If we have an n-sided polygon, it is called an n-gon.</p>
                        <p>ANGLE SUM PROPERTY:</p>
                         <p>The sum of all interior angles of a polygon is called the angle sum.</p>
                         <p>Angle sum of polygon=(n-2)x180 degree,</p>
                         <p>Where n=no. of sides of the polygon.</p>
                         <p>At one vertex, we extend a side. This side makes an angle with its consecutive side. This angle is called the exterior </p>
                         <p>angle. The interior angle and the exterior angles are adjacent angles.  These angles form a linear pair. Hence the sum of the
                          exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degree</p>
                           
                           <p>Angle sum of a polygon=(n-2)x180 degree.</p>

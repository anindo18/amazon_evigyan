                        <h1>Practical Geometry</h1><br>
                        <h2>CIRCLES</h2>
                        <P>Wheel is the one of the ancient inventions of man. Man has utilised the convention of the wheel completely to his benefit using the wheel according to the necessities, such as in the transport vehicles, Industries, in communication devices, art and architecture
                          and in other fields. This has changed the entire life style of mankind.</P>
                        <p>Wheel is circular in shape. Circle has many special properties. Because of these properties, circular shapes are immensely useful to man.</p>
                        <p>Remember : Equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre</p>
                        <p>Think : a) As the length of the chord increases, the perpendicular distance ...........</p>
                        <p>b) As the length of the chord decreases, the perpendicular distance ............</p>
                        <p>c) What would be the perpendicular distance between the biggest chord</p>
                        <p>Activity : * Draw circles of different radii on a sheet of paper.</p>
                        <p>* Mark their centres.</p>
                        <p>* Cut along the circumference of these circles.</p>
                        <p>* Fold each of these circular cutouts to form chords of different lengths.</p>
                        <p>* Mark the middle point of chords in each case.</p>
                        <p>* Again fold each of these cutouts along the line joining the centre and the middle point of the chord.</p>
                        <p>In each case compare the length of the chord and the perpendicular distance from the centre.</p>
                        <p> Construction of a segment of a circle</p>
                        <p>Activity : 1) Construct a circle of radius 3 cms on a sheet of a paper</p>
                        <p>2) Draw a chord of length 5 cms in it.</p>
                        <p>3) Cut along the circumference and obtain a circular cut out.</p>
                        <p>4) Cut along the chord down.</p>
                        <p>5) Mark the major and minor arcs in it.</p>
                        <p>In the figure, i) the region bounded by the chord PQ and the major arc PRQ is the major segment.</p>
                        <p>ii) the region bounded by the chord P minor arc PSQ is the minor segment</p>

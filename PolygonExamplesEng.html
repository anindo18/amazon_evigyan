                        <p>1) Find the number of nodes, arcs and regions in the following networks.</p>
                        <p>Solution : In this graph, A, B, C, D and E are nodes.</p>
                        <p>AB, BC, CD, DE, AE and AC are arcs.</p>
                         <img src="image_math/3.png" width="300" height="300">
                         <p>The regions are, the area within ABC, area</p>
                         <p>within ACDE and the area outside ABDE.</p>
                         <p>The number of nodes = N = 5</p>
                         <p>The number of arcs = A = 6</p>
                         <p>The number of regions = R = 3</p>
                         <p>2) Find N, A and R of the following graph</p>
                         <img src="image_math/16.png" width=300 height=300>
                         <p>In the network nodes are A, B, C and D</p>
                         <p>The Arcs are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6</p>
                         <p>The regions are a, b, c and d.</p>
                         <p>The number of nodes = N = 4</p>
                         <p>The number of Arcs = A = 6</p>
                         <p>The number of regions = R = 4</p>
                         <p>3) Find the number of nodes and arcs in the
graph given below</p>
                          <img src="image_math/17.png" width=300 height=300>
                          <p>Solution : The nodes are A, B and C. The
arcs are AB, AC and the arc joining A to A.</p>
                          <p>∴ The number of nodes = N = 3
The number of arcs = A = 3.</p>
                          <p>4) Four friends meet in a party and shake their
hands mutually. Draw a graph. Write the
number of nodes and arcs in it.</p>
                          <img src="image_math/18.png" width=300 height=300>
                          <p>Let A, B, C and D be four friends.
The line segments joining A, B, C and D
represent the mutual handshakes.</p>
                          <p>Here the nodes are A, B, C and D and the
arcs are AB, BC, CD, DA, AC and BD</p>
                          <p>∴N = 4 and A = 6</p>
                          <p><b>Note :</b> In the figure, The point of intersection of AC and BD is not taken
as a node because A shakes hand with C and B shakes hand with D and
it is represented by arcs AC and BD.</p>

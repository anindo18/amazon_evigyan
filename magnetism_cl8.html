        <p>Magnetism is the force where objects are attracted or repelled to one another. Usually these objects are metals such as iron.

Magnetic Poles, Forces, and Fields

Every magnet has two poles. This is where most of its magnetic strength is most powerful. These poles are called north and south or north-seeking and south seeking poles. The poles are called this as when a magnet is hung or suspended the magnet lines up in a north - south direction. When the north pole of one magnet is placed near the north pole of another magnet, the poles are repelled. When the south poles of two magnets are placed near one another, they also are repelled from one another. When the north and south poles of two magnets are placed near one another, they are attracted to one another.

The attraction repelling of two magnets towards one another depends on how close they are to each other and how strong the magnetic force is within the magnet. The further apart of the magnets are the less they are attracted or repelled to one another.

When a magnet is broken into little pieces, a north pole will appear at one of the broken faces and a south pole. Each piece, regardless of how big or small, has its own north and south poles. The are around a magnet can also behave like a magnet. This is called a magnetic field. The larger the magnet and the closer the object to the magnet, the greater the force of the magnetic field.

Magnetic Materials

The term magnetism is derived from Magnesia, the name of a region in Asia Minor where lodestone, a naturally magnetic iron ore, was found in ancient times. Iron is not the only material that is easily magnetized when placed in a magnetic field; others include nickel and cobalt.

Magnets can also be formed that are called electromagnets. A simple electromagnet is formed with a battery and copper wire coiled around a metal rod such as a nail. There is evidence that there is an electrical basis for magnetism

        <h3><a name="types">TYPES OF MAGNETIC MATERIALS:</a></h3>
        <h4>Diamagnetic Substance:</h4>
        <p>These  materials have a weak, negative susceptibility to magnetic fields. Diamagnetic materials are slightly repelled by a magnetic field and the material does not retain the magnetic properties when the external field is removed. In diamagnetic materials all the electron are paired so there is no permanent net magnetic moment per atom. Diamagnetic properties arise from the realignment of the electron paths under the influence of an external magnetic field. Most elements in the periodic table, including copper, silver, and gold, are diamagnetic.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Paramagnetic Materials:</h4>
        <p>These  materials have a small, positive susceptibility to magnetic fields. These materials are slightly attracted by a magnetic field and the material does not retain the magnetic properties when the external field is removed. Paramagnetic properties are due to the presence of some unpaired electrons, and from the realignment of the electron paths caused by the external magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include magnesium, molybdenum, lithium, and tantalum.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Ferromagnetic Materials:</h4>
        <p>These materials have a large, positive susceptibility to an external magnetic field. They exhibit a strong attraction to magnetic fields and are able to retain their magnetic properties after the external field has been removed. Ferromagnetic materials have some unpaired electrons so their atoms have a net magnetic moment. They get their strong magnetic properties due to the presence of magnetic domains. In these domains, large numbers of atom's moments (1012 to 1015) are aligned parallel so that the magnetic force within the domain is strong. When a ferromagnetic material is in the unmagnitized state, the domains are nearly randomly organized and the net magnetic field for the part as a whole is zero. When a magnetizing force is applied, the domains become aligned to produce a strong magnetic field within the part. Iron, nickel, and cobalt are examples of ferromagnetic materials. Components with these materials are commonly inspected using the magnetic particle method.</p>

        <h3>MOLECULAR THEORY OF MAGNETS:</h3>
        <p>Molecular theory is the first of theory that made an attempt to explain the phenomenon of magnetism. It attempt to explain the phenomenon of magnetism. It attempted to find the reason foe the magnetic property of substance at the molecular level. According to this theory, <b><i>every molecule of a magnet behave like a magnet. Every molecular magnet has two poles, namely north pole and south poles. Molecular magnet have the ability to rotate around the centres. All substances even the unmagnetised materials are made up of such molecules</i></b></p>
        <h4>1. Observation:</h4>
        <p>Certain Substances do not exhibit magnetic properties whereas some other substances do</p>
        <br>
        <h4> Explanation:</h4>
        <p>All substance s are made up of molecules that behave like magnets. In non-magnetic substances the molecules are scattered randomly. Hence the effect of poles of molecular magnets cancel each other. Hence they do not exhibit magnetic properties. In a magnet, all the molecular magnets are arranged in the same direction parallel to each other. Hence the effect of poles of molecular magnets add up. Therefore the magnets exhibits magnetism</p>
        <hr width="50%">
        <h4>2. Observation:</h4>
        <p>An iron piece becomes a magnet when rubbed with a magnet</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Explanation</h4>
        <p>In an iron piece, molecular magnets are arranged randomly. When it is rubbed with a magnet in any one direction, these molecular magnets get arranged in an orderly manner. Therefore the iron piece gets magnetized.</p>
        <hr width="50%">
        <h4>3. Observation:</h4>
        <p>Attraction of maximum at the end of the two ends of a magnet</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Explanation:</h4>
        <p>The net resultant of the tiny magnets will lead to the formation of the north and the south pole. Almost the entire magnetism is concentrated at the two poles of the magnet</p>
        <hr width="50%">
        <h4>4. Observation:</h4>
        <p>The poles of a magnet cannot be separated</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Explanation</h4>
        <p>Each tiny magnet has a north and a south pole. They cannot be separated since an atom cannot be divided into two</p>
        <hr width="50%">
        <h4>5. Observation:</h4>
        <p>A magnet loses its magnetism when it is dropped or red hot</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Explanation:</h4>
        <p>Whenever a magnet is dropped, the uni-directional orderly arrangement of molecular magnets gets distributed. Kinetic energy of molecular magnets increase when heated. Therefore, when heated the molecular magnets attain a disorderly arrangement</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h2>PROTECTION OF MAGNETISM:</h2>
        <p>Magnetism is lost if a magnet is heated red hot or dropped from a considerable height or bitten with a hammer. Magnetism may be lost if magnets are kept in a disarray. Magnets must be kept in a specific manner to ensure retention of magnetism for a long time.Let us now learn the technique of preserving magnets.</p>
        <p>First keep two bar magnets with a wooden piece in between them, so that their opposite poles point the same direction. Then join the opposite poles at each end with soft iron pieces, these are called magnetic keepers.Similarly, horse-shoe magnet or U-shaped are also preserved by using keepers</p>

        <h3>COOL USES OF MAGNETS:</h3>
        <dl>
   <dt><b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</b></dt>
  <dd>Magnetic resonance imaging, more commonly known by its acronym, MRI, is a technique that uses a powerful magnetic field to see inside of the body, like an X-ray. MRIs work by aligning the protons of hydrogen atoms in the magnetic field. Radio waves spin the protons, sending a faint but detectable signal. An MRI machine is able to use these signals to create highly detailed images of the inside of a person's body, allowing physicians to see a large variety of abnormalities and make complex diagnoses.</dd>
  <dt><b>Cow Magnets:</b></dt>
  <dd>When a cow grazes, it doesn't discriminate very much. Cows will swallow all kinds of foreign objects, such as nails or staples. When a cow swallows these items, it can cause damage to the cow's organs, resulting in sickness, decreased weight and decreased milk production in the case of a milking cow. To prevent this from happening, farmers often have their cows swallow a very powerful magnet called a cow magnet. This magnet keeps metal pieces from moving down the digestive tract of the cow by containing it with the magnet in the stomach.</dd>
  <dt><b>Computers:</b></dt>
  <dd>Magnets have a vast number of uses in everyday life, including computers. Magnets are used as methods of storing data, including long-term storage. In magnetic data storage, a magnetic surface is passed over by a device called a read/write head, which writes data as alterations in the magnetic field of the surface. This same device can read the magnetic fields on the surface and interpret them as ones and zeros. Magnets have other uses in computers, most notably as an integral component in speakers.</dd>
  <dt><b>Maglev Trains:</b></dt>
  <dd>Traditional trains run on wheels along a track. While they are noted for efficiency, there is quite a bit of friction generated on the wheels, which slows down the train. Magnetic levitation, or maglev, trains use a very simple principle of magnetic forces to get around this: magnets of the same polarity repel each other. Magnets on the train repel those in the track, which levitates the train off of the ground. A magnetic guideway propels the train along the track, which means the train needs no engine. These trains are very energy efficient and extremely fast, running at a top speed of 300 miles per hour.</dd>

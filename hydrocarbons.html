        <h3>HYDROCARBONS</h3>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>You have studied the role of carbon in the
origin and evolution of life on earth.
Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and vitamins
are classes of a few organic compounds. These
compounds are the essential components of
food. The branch of chemistry which studies the compounds of carbon is broadly
called organic chemistry. One of the importand group of organic compounds that
are useful to us is hydrocarbons. In this chapter we will be studying about
hydrocarbons.</p>
        <h4>HYDROCARBONS</h4>
         <p>Hydrocarbons are the organic compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen,
only. Petroleum fuels are basically hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are used as raw
materials for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, dyes and many more
polymers. Let us study about hydrocarbons in detail.
Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon. Molecular
formula of methane is CH4. The chemical bonding of
CH4 is shown in the figure.
The molecular formula does not explain the arrangement of atoms in a
molecule. The representation of arrangement of atoms and bonds present in
molecule is known as its structural formula. A bond ‘‘____“ indicates a pair of
shared electrons between two atoms.</p>

         <h4>CLASSIFICATION OF HYDROCARBONS</h4>
          <p>Hydrocarbons are classified into Aliphatic and Aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic
compounds will be discussed later.<br>
Aliphatic hydrocarbons are those which are derived out of fat. There are two
types of Aliphatic hydrocarbons - Acyclic hydrocarbons and cyclic hydrocarbons.
Aliphatic hydrocabons are further classified as alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.</p>
          <img src="image_chemistry/9.png" height="800" width="500">
         <p>These are compounds containing single bonds between carbon atoms. They
are called Alkanes. They are also known as paraffins.<br>
Observe the relationship between the number of carbon atoms and number of
hydrogen atoms in each compound. Number of hydrogen atoms are two more
than twice number of carbon atom in each compound. Therefore this class of
compound is represented by a general formula CnH2n+2, where “n” stands for the
number of carbon atoms.</p>
         <img src="image_chemistry/10.png" height="800" width="500">
         <p>These hydrocarbons are called alkynes. The hydrocarbon in which a double
bond exists between two succesive carbon atoms somewhere in the chain is
termed as an Alkene. The general formula of alkenes is CnH2n. In these
compounds two hydrongen atoms are less when compared with the corresponding
saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes).</p>
         <img src="image_chemistry/11.png" height="800" width="500">
         <p>These hydrocarbons are called alkynes. Each molecule of alkynes contains a
triple bond between two carbon atoms. In case where triple bond exists, we find
that the number of hydrogen atoms are further decreased. There are two
hydrogen atoms less than that of corresponding alkenes, hence these
hydrocarbons are represented by the general formula CnH2n-2.<br>

Alkenes and Alkynes put together are generalised as unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Now let us consider alicyclic hydrocarbons which are also aliphatic in nature.
Study the following compounds</p>
         <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons are a big class of hydrocarbons. Most of the members
of this group have characteristic odour. Hence, they are called aromatic compounds.
Benzene is the first member of aromatic hydrocarbons. Molecular formula of
benzene is C6H6. In benzene six carbon atoms are linked to each other by
alternate single and double bonds to form a ring. Its structural formula is as
follows:</p>

          <img src="image_chemistry/13.png" height="800" width="500">
          <p>In some aliphatic hydrocarbons, a branch may exist in the carbon chain. Such
compounds are called branched chain hydrocarbons. Let us consider the example
of butane. Molecular formula of butane is C4H10. What could be its structural
formula? Butane can be represented by the following structures.</p>

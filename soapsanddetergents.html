        <h3>SOAPS AND DETERGENTS</h3>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>When water is used for washing, it dissolves dirt; but some dirt will not
dissolve in water. Soaps and detergents help water to remove dirt. The word
detergent means something which cleans. Soapnut powder has been in use for
about 3,000 years. In India even now some still use soapnut powder as a natural
soap to remove oily substance. People have been using soap for a long time.</p>
        <h3>SOAPS</h3>
        <p>Metallic salts prepared from natural fats
are called soaps. Soap is a sodium salt or
potasium salt of long chain fatty acids that
has cleansing action in water. Sodium
stearate, sodium oliate and sodium palmitate
are some examples of soaps.<br>
Stearic acid is a long chain fatty acid. Its
formula is C17H35COOH. This reacts with
sodium hydroxide to give a compound called
sodium stearate, which has properties of
soap.<br>
Similarly, sodium hydroxide reacts with
oleic acid and palmitic acid forming sodium
oleate (C17H33COONa) and sodium palmitate
(C17H31COONa) respectively.</p>
        
        <h4>PREPARATION OF SOAP</h4>
        <p>Experiment : Take about 30 ml of a vegetable oil in a beaker. Add about 60
ml of 20% sodium hydroxide solution to it. Heat slowly until the mixture boils. After
5-10 minutes of boiling, add about 5g of sodium chloride to separate soap from
the solution. Cool the solution. Observe the creamy layer of soap floating on the
solution.<br>
We need animal fat or vegetable oil, sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride
for preparing soap. Fat or vegetable oil is a glyceride or a glyceryl ester. Soap
is prepared by hydrolyzing fat or oil with bases such as sodium hydroxide or
potassium hydroxide. <br>This process of preparing soap is called saponification.
When a mixture of a oil/fat and a
strong solution of sodium hydroxide is
boild in an iron tank, a sodium salt of
the fatty acid and glycerol are formed.
The sodium salt of the fatty acid thus
formed is nothing but soap.<br>
Oil/fat + s•odium hydroxide → soap + glycerol</p>

        <p>Soap thus formed is separated with the help of sodium chloride. Addition of
sodium chloride reduces the solubility of soap considerable. Soap, being lighter,
floats like a cream on the solution. It is separated from the solution, suitable
chemicals of suitable colour and odour are added to it and cast into moulds.
When soap cools and solidifies, it is cut into desired shapes and packed.
Glycerol exists in dissolved state in the solution. It is separated by distillation.</p>
        <h4>DETERGENTS</h4>
        <p>The term detergent is derived from a Latin word which means surface active.
Synthetic detergents are commonly known as detergents. Detergents are also
called soap less soaps. Detergents do not form insoluble ‘scum’ with magnesium
and calcium ions present in hard water. Therefore, detergents clean better than
soap even in hard water.<br>
Detergents are sodium salts of long chain benzene sulphonic acid or sodium
salts of long chain alkyl hydrogen sulphate. A detergent molecule consists of a
large hydrocarbon group that is non-ionic and a sulphonate (SO3
- Na+) or a
Hydrocarbon end
(Water repelling)
Ionic end
(Water attracting)
sulphate (SO4
- Na+) group that is ionic. Sodium n-dodecyl benzene sulphonate
and Sodium dodecyl sulphate are two well-known detergents.<br>
Let us now consider a method of making detergents. Long chain hydrocarbons
obtained from petroleum are treated with concentrated sulphuric acid. The
organic acids produced during this process are neutralized with sodium hydroxide.
The sodium salt obtained is a detergent.</p>
        <h4>ADVANTAGES OF DETERGENTS OVER SOAPS</h4>
        <p>Detergents have more advantages than soap. Therefore, detergents are more
widely used than soap. Let us now turn our focus towards the advantages of
detergents.<br>
* Detergents cleanse well even in hard water. Soap is not so good for
washing when water is hard.<br>
* Detergents are made from hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. Soap is
prepared from vegetable oil or animals fat that are usually edible. Detergents
are not bio-degradable. Soaps are biodegradable.<br>
* Detergents cleanse well even in acidic medium. Soap does not cleanse well
in such a medium.<br>
Detergents have their disadvanges.<br>
* Detergents are not bio-degradable. They polutes water and soil.</p>

            The term crop is used to describe plants of the same kind that are grown and cultivated at one place in significant quantities. Plants that are planted during the rainy season are called kharif crops. Crops that grow during the winter season are called rabi crops. 
Many activities are performed before cultivating a crop, which are termed as agricultural practices. Soil preparation means loosening the soil or turning it. Earthworms decompose plant and animal waste, and thereby benefit the soil by increasing the humus and nutrient level in it. Ploughs have been in use since ancient times for tilling soil, adding manure and fertilisers, and for scraping of soil. Depending upon the animals available on a farm, ploughing is done using horses and camels to pull ploughs. A plank is used to break the crumbs into fine soil. The next step is to level the soil with the help of a leveller.

Ploughs were made from wood. Nowadays, iron ploughs have become more popular. Earlier, a hoe was used for tilling, but these days we use it only to remove weeds. When the cultivator is pulled by a tractor, the teeth assist in breaking the soil.Healthy seeds contain more nutrients.Damaged seeds are hollow, discoloured and contain fewer nutrients.Seed selection is done by soaking the seeds in a beaker containing water.Modern seed drills sow seeds at a proper depth and distance, and cover them with a layer of soil, keeping them well out of a birdâ€™s reach. The traditional seed drill contains a funnel-shaped container, from where the seeds pass and get placed into the soil. Bananas are first sown in a nursery and the saplings are planted in the field.

            Agriculture is cultivating on large areas.Manure provides soil with nutrients. The crop has been harvested last week and is left fallow to recover nutrients. Decomposition occurs in pits dumped with organic waste with the help of earthworms and bacteria. 
Fertilisers are chemicals used to add minerals like potassium, phosphorus and nitrates to the soil. The supply of water to crop is irrigation. The frequency of irrigation varies from season to season. Manure increases the water retention capacity of soil, making it porous. Plants contain nearly 90% water, and need water for proper development of flowers, fruits and seeds. In dry conditions, seeds do not germinate. Water protects plants from frostbite and hot air currents. Water protects crops from hot air by evaporation, and traps cold breeze. Traditional methods of irrigation include moat, chain pump, dhekli and rahat, and need animal and human labour to draw water.

Wells, tube wells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams and canals are sources of water. Sprinklers and drip systems are used when the soil is sandy or uneven. Pumps lift water and run on biogas or solar energy. During summer, it is difficult for farmers to water crops. Weeds are removed manually before they produce flowers and seeds. Weeds are controlled by chemicals such as 2, 4-D, a systemic weedicide that kills weeds. Weedicides are poisonous to humans. Drip irrigation waters fruit plants and suits regions that have scarcity of water. Khurpi is used to remove weeds. Farmers use weedicides in diluted form and they handle weedicides carefully by covering their nose and mouth while spraying. This stops their propagation in the field. Tilling the soil uproots the weeds.

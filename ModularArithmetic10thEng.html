                        <h1>Modular Arithmetic</h1><br>
                        <h2>1 Congruence of Numbers</h2>
                        <p>We are familiar with the twelve hours clock. Although there are 24 hours in a day,the face of the clock shows only 12 hours.</p>
                        <p>We consider,</p>
                        <p>13th hour of the day is equivalent to 1st hour.</p>
                        <p>17th hour of the day is equivalent to 5th hour/etc.</p>
                        <p>This is true because repetition occurs after 12 single steps</p>
                        <p>This system is ‘modulo 12’</p>
                        <p>The relation is expressed as</p>
                        <p>13 Congruent to 1 (mod 12)</p>
                        <p>17 Congruent to 5 (mod 12)</p>
                        <p>In modular arithmetic, these relations are symbolically expressed as,</p>
                        <p>13 ≡ 1 (mod 12)</p>
                        <p>17 ≡ 5 (mod 12)</p>
                        <p>24 ≡ 0 (mod 12) etc.,</p>
                        <h2>2. Set of Residues</h2>
                        <p>When a positive integer is divided by 3, then the remainders will be 0, 1 or 2.
                          Here all the differences are multiples of 7 160 Similarly, when any positive integer is divided by 5, then the remainders will be 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. In general if any positive integer is divided by ‘m’, then the remainders will be one of the following i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3 ................... (m-1)</p>
                        <p>Hence</p>
                        <p>0, 1 and 2, are called the residues of ‘modulo 3’</p>
                        <p>ˆ {0, 1, 2} is the set of mod 3</p>
                        <p>0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 are called the residues of ‘modulo 5’</p>
                        <p>ˆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is the set of mod 5</p>
                        <p>0, 1, 2, 3 ........... (m-1) are the residues of modulo m</p>
                        <p>ˆ {0, 1, 2 .................. (m-1)} is the set of mod m</p>
                        <p>Set of residues “modulo m” is denoted by Zm</p>
                        <p>∴ {0, 1, 2 .................. (m-1)} is the set of mod m</p>
                        <p>Set of residues “modulo m” is denoted by Zm</p>

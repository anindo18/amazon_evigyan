                      <h2>Permutations</h2>
                      <p>Permutation is an orderly arrangement of objects.</p>
                      <p>The concept of permutations and combinations have applications in solving problems and genetic engineering.</p>
                      <p>In nPr, n and r are positive integers.n>=r</p>
                      <p>nPr means the number of permutations of 'n' things taking 'r' things at a time.</p>
                      <p>If one event occurs in 'm' different ways and another event occurs independently in 'n' different ways then the events together can be done in(m*n) different ways.</p>
                      <p>The product of first 'n' consecutive natural numbers is denoted by n! and is read as factorial n.</p>

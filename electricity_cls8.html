        <h2>DEFINITION:</h2>
        <p>Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and the flow of electrical current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.</p>
        <h2>UNIT OF ELECTRICITY:</h2>
        <p>The unit of measurement of electricity is <b><i>"Joule"</i></b></p>
        <p>Since, joule is a very small unit, a small unit called Kilojoule is also used.</p>
        <p>1KJ = 1000J</p>
        <br>
        <h2>ELECTRIC POWER:</h2>
        <p>The rate at which work is done by electricity is called electric power.</p>
        <p>Electric Power= <b>The work done by electricity / time</b></p>
        <h2>Practical unit of Electricity</h2>
        <p>For practical use, the unit for electricity used is kiloWatt-hour(kWh)</p>
        <p>Let us assume that we are using 1000 joules of electricity every second. If we continue to check</p>

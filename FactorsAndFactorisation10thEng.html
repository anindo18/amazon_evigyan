                        <p>H.C.F and L.C.M</p>
                        <p>Identify the common factor among the given expression.Write the H.C.F</p>
                        <p>Steps to be followed while finding the H.C.F by division method.<br>
                        1.Arrange the terms of the expression in decreasing order of the powers in two columns.<br>
                        2.If the powers of the first terms in the expression are same,consider the term which has a smaller coefficient as divisor,and divide.<br>
                        3.Continue the division process till remainder of one of the expression reduces to zero.<br>
                        4.The last divisor is the H.C.F of two expressions.
                        5.If the last remainder is constant and not zero,then the HCF of two expressions is 1.In other words,the two expressions are prime to each other.</p>
                        <p>The product of the H.C.F and L.C.M of two expressions is equal to the product of the expressions<br>
                        A*B=H*L</p>
                        <p>L.C.M by division method:</p>
                        <p>When the expressions cannot be easily resolved into factors,the L.C.M of two expressions can be found by using the relation A*B=H*L<br>
                        Divide one of the two expressions by their H.C.F then the product of the quotient and the other expression will be the L.C.M.<br>
                        i.e.L=A/B or L=A*B/H</p>
                        <h2>SURDS</h2>
                        <p>A group of surds of the same order having the same radicand in their reduced form called "Like Surds"</p>
                        <p>A group of surds of the different order having the different or both radicand in their reduced form called "Unlike Surds"</p>
                        <p>The process of multiplying a surd by another surd to get a rational number is called Rationalisation.Then each surd is a rationalising factor(R.F) of the order.</p>
                        <p>Binomial surds:<br>
                        A binomial surd is the algebraic sum of two distinct monomial surds or the algebraic sum of a rational number and a monomial surd.</p>
                        <p>Simplification by rationalising the denominator:<br>
                        while rationalising the denominator both the numerator and denominator must be multiplied by the rationalising factor of the denominator.</p>
                        <p>When the denominators are conjugates to each other,it can be simplified by taking L.C.M</p>

                        <h1>Statistics</h1><br>
                        <p>Statistics is the science of collection,classification,tabulation,analysis and interpretation of numerical data.</p>
                        <p>The measures of dispersion,which are common use:<br>
                        1.Range<br>
                        2.Quartile deviation<br>
                        3.Mean deviation<br>
                        4.Standard deviation</p>
                        <h2>Standard deviation</h2>
                        <p>Standard data is the set of observation of characteristics of individual as age, height,weight,income,marks scored etc.,These characteristics are generally called variables.</p>
                        <p>The square root of variance is the standard deviation of the distribution.</p>
                        <p>The standard deviation is conventionally represented by the Greek letter Sigma</p>
                        <p>Standard deviation is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviation from the mean.</p>
                        <p>Working rule:<br>
                        When individual observation are given.<br>
                        1.The arithmetic mean is computed.<br>
                        2.The deviation of the individual scores from the arithmetic mean are obtained.<br>
                        3.The squares of the deviations are calculated.<br>
                        4.The sum of the squared deviations is divided by the number of observations.<br>
                        5.This value is the variance.<br>
                        6.The positive square root of variance is the standard deviation.</p>
